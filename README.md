# Sales Cleanup ETL Script

## Project Summary

This is a simple data engineering project to demonstrate a basic ETL process using Python and pandas. A raw CSV file of addresses was cleaned by:
- Removing rows with missing values
- Standardizing column names (lowercase, underscores)
- Exporting to a clean CSV file

This script is the first step in building foundational data engineering skills: ingest, transform, and export.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- Git + GitHub
